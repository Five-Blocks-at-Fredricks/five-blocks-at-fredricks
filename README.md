# Five Blocks at Fredricks
 Five Blocks at Fredricks (Or fbaf) is a fnaf fan game meant to be goofy.

 It is made in a blocky art style and isn't meant to be that scary.

 It totally isn't in a blocky art style because I've literally never made a 3d model before.

 This game is in VERY early development.
